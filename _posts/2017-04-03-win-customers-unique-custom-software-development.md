It is needless to say, for it is obvious that there is no business without customers. In fact, a business’ competitive edge is judged on the basis of how well they win and retains customers. But when businesses think about winning customers, not many think custom software development. Instead, they launch expensive marketing campaigns. But as it happens, custom software is one of the best tools for getting to customers to pay attention and get hooked.

Customers discover businesses through web presence. A business’ website and mobile app can make such a significant first impression to customers. In other words, websites and mobile apps provide vast marketing and sales opportunities businesses’ can tap and leverage for competitive advantage.

Below are some of the ways that custom software development can help businesses to win customers:

**User-Friendly Apps**

In this regard, we are talking custom software development design. When a business works closely with their software development partners from beginning to end, it can go a long way in helping achieve a business’ goals.

It is no doubt important for businesses to consider what they want their software to do. But it is just as important to consider what the software should not do. Particularly, on this note, a business must consider questions operating system, but also the user interface.

Flaws on the digital storefront, as well as web and mobile apps, can be detrimental to business by affecting customer confidence. The confusing or tricky software can be deterrent to buyers, thereby creating additional work.

It is, therefore, of utmost importance for a business to think of the customers when designing software and apps. The development team must ask and seek answers to questions on what customers like about and want from their store or website; and what complaints customers share. The feedback on these questions can provide a valuable roadmap for ultimate user-friendly software and app.

It is important to know the distinction between interacting and engaging with users/customers. Because, while all apps do interact with users, only the best engage with them. A fun software and app see more feedback from customers than one that is annoying. By utilizing previews, graphics as well as other features compatible with interfaces (both traditional and contemporary, e.g. a touch screen) in the process of custom software development, a business can make sure that its software and apps leave a mark on the customers’ minds.

**Selling Safety**

Even as e-commerce has continued to grow, and more consumers are increasingly preferring the efficiency and convenience of online purchasing; online security has continued to become an even more pressing issue.

For a business to win customers, they must run secure software and apps. Custom software development offers businesses the best and most secure software. It is tailored to suit the needs of the business and having done that its unique design deters hackers, thereby limiting a business’ vulnerability to attack. Besides, hackers use and share the same tricks and loopholes, so that custom software pose new challenges for them.

But also most important, other than having secure software and apps, businesses must inform customers about the securities of them (software and apps) through marketing. Indeed, customers do take notice when search engine and browser companies (such as Google) announce plans to remove all websites that are unsecured from their results.

**Utilizing Sales in Software**

Custom software development has come a long way. For instance, today there are the web and mobile apps that can do much work on behalf of businesses, including a considerable amount of sales. Software and apps that use discrete suggestions and also present various logical options can help to connect customers to the right services and products.

A business’ web and mobile apps should be able to serve as an active guide for customers, and not just act as a passive catalog of inventory. A business may provide customers (who need suggestions and help) with chat options, but mostly customers go through the software or app alone. Therefore, businesses need to think of their software and apps as not just a destination, but also as an employee. Companies can use the innate security of their custom software as a sale point, which allows the software and app to walk customers through a sale.
