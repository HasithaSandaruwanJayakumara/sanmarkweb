Establishing an online business is not just about the selection, cost, and quality of service. Your online store’s interface and practical features should impress and attract customers.

Let’s discuss the most updated wanted specifications for an eCommerce website.

## 1. Integrations with 3rd Parties

Knowing which third-party connectors you’ll need for your newly created e-commerce site is essential. This functional requirement focuses on optimizing business processes for your website’s clients, including flexible payment methods, ERP, CRM, and PIM. Choosing the appropriate third-party integrations for your website will prepare it for future business growth.

## 2. Responsiveness to Mobile Devices

Most visitors to websites today come from mobile devices, particularly smartphones. Future growth of the population is guaranteed. Therefore, spending money to create a mobile-responsive website might pay off in more ways than one. Additionally, the consumer base will give you more loyalty.

An analytical tool can be used to research your audience and find out their method of accessing your website. Be aware of where key buttons and options are located on the websites. Change them to reflect this for a better purchasing experience.

## 3. Product Specification

E-commerce businesses should be able to implement various product characteristics in the product detail pages. Will the consumer simply select the product’s color and size? Are videos on a product detail page required? Will some product characteristics be listed on a menu similar to a mega menu? List all the crucial product characteristics that might help customers choose your products.

## 4. Social Networking

Having a social media presence is crucial for any e-commerce firm. Allowing users to share material from your website on social media will raise brand awareness and bring you and your consumers closer. Learn about the social networks that your target demographic uses most frequently. You may encourage your customers to share your goods, blog posts, and motivational images by including a matching button on your website.

## 5. The Flow of Order &amp; Checkout

It’s crucial to mention how orders will be processed in your online store. In particular, you must decide if you want your website visitor to register or whether he can make a transaction as a guest user. You can list the statuses of your orders, which will be visible to customers and the store admins. Describe the Business-to-Business order management process. You need to know every last functional aspect of the order and checkout flows.

At this point, you must also specify the discount and coupon policy (if any).

## 6. Website Speed

The ability of a browser to load fully functional web pages from a specific site speedily is referred to as website speed, also known as website performance. Users may leave websites that function poorly and take a long time to load. On the other hand, sites that load rapidly often get more visitors and convert at a higher rate.

**As you can see, it’s challenging to design an engaging user experience for eCommerce sites. Your conversion rate will rise if you can master these universal principles. Users are instructed to shop online step-by-step and stay on course. Your sales will improve if you stick to the fundamentals and carry them out to the most outstanding levels.**
