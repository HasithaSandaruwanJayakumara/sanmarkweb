Year after year, the company’s market share grows, implying that there are more reasons for consumers to choose it.

One cause for such market expansion is the current boom in online purchasing, which demands a safe, dependable, and simple service, which may be supplied through the integrated PayPal payment gateway.

It allows clients to do transactions in one of the 26 most widely used currencies, without country restrictions.

## Payment Options from PayPal

![How-to-Integrate-PayPal-into-Your-Business-Website]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/How-to-Integrate-PayPal-into-Your-Business-Website-post-image.webp){:width="800" height="400" .img-fluid .w-100}[https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/\_20083122.htm](https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/_20083122.htm){: target="_blank"}

PayPal becomes significantly more than a simple digital money processor with a wide range of transaction choices. Let’s look at the payment options that PayPal accepts for businesses.

1. **Express Checkout**

    PayPal express checkout connection ensures quick and simple transactions for your customers. Customers do not need to enter any payment or shipping information, allowing PayPal integration on the website, iOS, or Android user-friendly and thereby aiding in sales growth. Because the platform’s tools process payments, a client is routed from the site/application to perform a transaction and then returns to complete the purchase once payment is received. Keep in mind that PayPal Express connection is only available if the consumer already has a PayPal account.

2. **Direct Payment**

    Customers without PayPal accounts can use the Direct payment approach to make online purchases. This enables you to integrate transaction operations into your website/application, avoiding redirection. After the user confirms a purchase and clicks Pay, your app will contact the API to complete the order. This is the most convenient method If a customer wants to use a debit or credit card. The customer remains on your website and is unaware that PayPal is processing the transaction. Because it appears more familiar and user-friendly, the Direct payment method claims to give a better user experience.

3. **Recurring Payment**

    Recurrent payments are commonly used for subscriptions: transactions are carried out annually in accordance with agreed-upon payment arrangements. You will need a business account and an easy PayPal interface to use this approach. To begin, you must manage your subscription plans, provide information about your product, provide subscription alternatives for your consumers to pick from, select a paying cycle, and add the appropriate button to your website/app.

4. **Mass Payment**

    The Mass Payment model is used when one payment needs to be split between several accounts. This approach is a simple way to pay commissions, prizes, or general expenses. Payouts assist retailers and e-commerce businesses, as well as businesses employing contingent workers and service providers. One disadvantage of this option is that you must use your PayPal balance or fund your account via bank transfer, and you cannot use debit or credit cards. With this payment arrangement, recipients do not pay any costs, however, senders do. PayPal integration is developer-friendly because the provider provides basic RESTful API standards.

2. **Select an Appropriate API Model**

    The next step is to select an appropriate API model. There are various methods for integrating the PayPal API. Let’s examine them in more detail:

        - Payflow Pro API (which uses an iframe; the data entering form is provided by PayPal).
        - Payflow Link API (which is identical to the previous one).{: .pl-10}

3. **Create a Sandbox Account**

    A sandbox environment allows a development team to test how a product works before integrating PayPal into an Android/iOS app or site.

    The Sandbox profile allows you to monitor the app’s progress, track metrics, and simulate chargebacks, complaints, and transaction delays/denials in a virtual testing environment.

    Note that test and production versions are not the same, which can lead to issues when switching between them.
