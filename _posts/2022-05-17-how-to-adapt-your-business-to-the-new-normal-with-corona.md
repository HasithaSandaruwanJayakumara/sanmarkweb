The coronavirus pandemic made an unprecedented impact worldwide, creating one of the biggest challenges for businesses all around the world.

Companies with digital platforms begin to have a great advantage, forcing the competition to refocus all their marketing strategies and their operation and distribution channels in order to remain competitive in the market. A lot of companies were affected and some of them are still struggling to keep afloat.

## **Don’t Focus on the Difficulties**

Don’t focus only on the problems. Of course, you have to overcome certain difficulties to be able to take the next step but don’t assume that when everything returns to “normal”, your business will too.

When we leave everything on standby, we enter a phase of stagnation and we take for granted that, no matter what happens, the situation will not let us move forward. We don’t realize that this is the perfect time to unleash our creativity and ability to make a better business proposal, with strategic moves that will allow us to exploit future opportunities.

Don’t let circumstances take control; take it as a push to innovate your business. Work hard to do even better what really works in your company, provide excellent service and make a difference.

It is time to evaluate, innovate and reinvent ourselves. Adapting to the circumstances to continue offering our services no matter what happens.

## **Diversify Your Business**

It’s time to get down to work to continue on our way. Let’s make the most of these difficult times.

Here are some things you should start considering:

### **1. Help Yourself with Technology**

If your business operates entirely in person, check how you can provide service through digital platforms. It is an excellent way to reinvent yourself and expand the options for your customers to enjoy what you offer. Move through different channels, so you can reach more people.

### **2. Establish Synergies**

Alliances play a fundamental role in reaching other consumers. Offering new products or services and moving into innovative markets is essential for your company’s growth and will add great value. Try holding your meetings outside your usual space and connect with other companies.

### **3. Review Your Products or Services**

Evaluate your market. And make sure that what you are offering is still relevant and interesting to your customers. Knowing your target audience well, knowing if their interests have changed, will give you the knowledge you need to make the right decisions when it comes to reshaping your proposition. Most importantly, let them know about your changes.

### **4. Keep in Touch with Your Customers**

Use a creative way to communicate, so that they don’t forget about you and know that you are still there, working and innovating. Send them information through a Newsletter about promotions, products or services and even interact on social networks with some contests.

### **5. Improve Your SEO Strategy**

This situation has prompted many more users to choose to make their purchases or seek services through the Internet. And everything seems to indicate that this practice will remain in time. For this reason, it is essential to optimize the SEO strategy in order not to be left behind.

### **6. It’s Time to Try New Stages**

Be insistent and persistent with your projects, it will surely be worth it. You will achieve much more than sitting idly by waiting for all the bad things to happen. Try to domicile your company outside the city and open your way in new markets. Get out of your comfort zone. Always making analysis and informed decisions. 

### **7. Think One Step Ahead**

Establish an emergency plan and work on new strategies to be taken in case things go wrong again. This is a very good alternative to be prepared for any future scenario; it will allow us to keep our bearings and not drift.

## **Reorienting Ourselves is the Solution**

It is becoming increasingly clear that this new reality is triggering a restructuring in the economic and social spheres. New patterns of behaviour will remain habits when the healthcare crisis is over.

All this mess may have affected our business model and the needs of our customers. But we can work in different ways that will impact and deepen our business and help us mitigate the losses. How? By redesigning our business model or even creating a new, totally different proposition.

Working hard every day to adjust our products and services to the needs and behavioural changes of our audience is vital for our business to make the most of any complicated circumstance.

Moreover, this applies not only to the pandemic but to any complex situation our business may go through. If we meet our customers’ needs, keep in touch and move into new markets, we are prepared for possible future scenarios.
