As a fan of computing technologies, you hight have been wondered about the term “cloud computing”. What is all about this cloud? Is it something which we can physically see or touch? Where can we find this cloud? Those are all of your questions which you are wondering how to find answers.

In the simplest definition, cloud computing is known as storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of using your computer’s hard drive. The cloud is just another representation for the Internet. It takes us back to the days of flowcharts and presentations that would represent the gigantic server-farm infrastructure of the Internet as nothing but a puffy, white cumulonimbus cloud, accepting connections and doling out information as it floats.

Cloud computing is *not all* about your hard drive. When you persist data on or execute programs from the hard drive, that’s known as *local* storage and computing. Everything you should need is physically close to you, which means requesting your data is fast and easy, for that one computer, or others on the local network. Working off your hard drive is how the computer industry operated for decades; some would debate it’s still superior to cloud computing.

The cloud can’t be introduced as having a dedicated network attached storage (NAS) hardware or server in residence. Persisting data on a home or office network does not count as utilizing the cloud.

For it to be known as “cloud computing,” you have to access your data or your programs over the Internet, or as the minimum requirement, have that data synchronized with other information over the Web. In an expanded business, you may know all there is to know about what’s on the other corner of the connection; as an individual user, you may never have any idea what kind of massive and complex data-processing is happening on the other end. The final result is the same: with an internet connection, cloud computing can be done anywhere, anytime.
