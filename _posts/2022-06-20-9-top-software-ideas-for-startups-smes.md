When it comes to startups and SMEs, the model of SaaS or Software as a Service is getting more and more popular. Nowadays you can find applications for almost everything. From diet and exercise to organization and finances you can get apps for almost everything and the idea of charging a monthly subscription fee has become a reality, becoming the SaaS model.  
If you want to jump on the bandwagon, here are some really good ideas that you could use for creating apps and software to launch your startup or to offer them to your SME.

## 1. Clothing and Accessories Analyzer

Imagine you are walking down the road and you meet a gentleman wearing a polo shirt that you find attractive and admire. With this type of application, you can take a photo of that polo shirt and then the application will analyze the shirt and give you details on where you can buy them.

## 2. Progress Tracker

Sometimes it can be difficult for us to analyze what progress we have made in our lives. To grow and succeed, it is important that we analyze ourselves well and perform self-introspection. Imagine an application that records details of what we have learned and the progress we have made on a daily basis. This application can be very useful for professionals who are quite ambitious in their lives and want to use every moment. Such an application is certainly very useful.

## 3. Scanning Food Calories and Ingredients

You can imagine being at a feast where there are varieties of food that you may not be familiar with. An app that can calculate the calories it contains along with the nutrients would be helpful. It would also be good if it mentions all the ingredients mixed in the food.

## 4. Time Valuator

We all know that time is money and money is time. If you waste time, you waste money. How about an application that allows you to help in time management, so you set working hours to earn a fixed set of income? The idea is about a time management calculator. It will help you to schedule working hours and earn the money required to meet future goals.

## 5. Customized Personal Motivation

We all need the motivation to keep going throughout the day. It doesn’t help to read generic motivational quotes, as people need something more personal. You can create an app that takes some details about you and develops personal motivational messages for you. It’s better than generic advice because it would actually apply to your situation.

## 6. Help App for Seniors

Every human being needs extra attention and care as they age, and seniors are gradually becoming an increasingly large category of app users. Create an app that will make their lives easier by planning their daily activities, reminding them about medications and utility bills, or simplifying the ordering and delivery of food products for their individual diet.

## 7. Summary of YouTube Videos

You can create an app that summarizes long YouTube videos. Many people want to watch those long videos, but simply don’t have the time. maybe it would show the most important clips from the video.

## 8. Virtual Interior Design

You can create an application that allows users to click on a picture of their room and try out curtains, sofas and other furniture. If things match, the buyer will make the purchase instantly. The app will have an add and remove option for easy navigation. Finally, designing a home will be a happy experience.

## 9. Recipes by Ingredients

Consider creating an application that offers recipes based on a list of products specified by the user. As an advanced feature, you can add the ability to set a calorie restriction. A simple scan of popular culinary websites could help you integrate thousands of recipes into the application’s database. Users get a general list and then familiarize themselves with the recipe in more detail on the source website.

All of these apps and software mentioned could be very useful in our daily lives. But you need to keep in mind that even if you have great new ideas for mobile apps or software, the success will largely depend on how they are implemented so study, analyze and plan everything before you start developing.
