description : "All about cloud infrastructure management services and how it helps a business. Read on to find out more!"

In recent times, many businesses have moved into the “cloud” and have reaped the many benefits offered by this new technology. The term cloud infrastructure applies to the physical and virtual components and services that are needed to build, deploy, and run software, applications and services over the internet. These are generally used by companies that create cloud-based applications and software. Cloud infrastructure management services are generally offered by a cloud service provider or third-party service provider, and are customisable according to a business’s needs and requirements. They assist these development companies to manage and maintain the applications they have created, leaving more resources and time for the business to allocate to more important tasks.

A cloud infrastructure typically includes the following (more details can be found via the following link [**https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/cloud-infrastructure-management.html**](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/cloud-infrastructure-management.html){: target="_blank"}):

- Servers: Physical or virtual servers that are used to both run applications and store data.
- Storage: Disk space for storing data.
- Networking: The virtual and physical infrastructure that is needed to transmit data between servers, storage systems, and users.
- Management tools: Software and tools for managing and monitoring the cloud infrastructure, as well as the application.
- Security: Technologies and processes for protecting data and privacy in order to ensure a secure experience for users.

Cloud infrastructure offers valuable benefits to businesses as they are highly scalable, flexible, and a cost-effective way for businesses to run software, applications and services without having to pay for and maintain expensive hardware and software, which is why many companies are now considering migrating to the cloud.

## **What is cloud infrastructure management?**

Cloud infrastructure management refers to the processes, tools, and techniques used to manage and operate cloud computing environments, which may include the following:

- Provisioning and configuring Resources: Setting up configuring the new resources as needed in terms of hardware and software requirements, such as virtual machines, storage systems, servers and network connections etc.
- Visibility and monitoring Performance: Monitoring and tracking the performance of a business’s cloud resources, and identifying and addressing any issues as and when they come up. These services may also include real-time alerts and notifications which help in detecting issues quickly and efficiently.
- Resource allocation: Dividing up the resources among the users and allowing for certain contingencies as and when needed, allowing greater control.
- Scaling: As business needs change, so will the resources that are needed. Adding or removing resources as required by the business to meet changing demands, and ensuring that the cloud infrastructure is always optimised for performance and cost.
- Maintenance: Keeping the cloud infrastructure up-to-date with security patches, software updates, and other maintenance tasks to ensure a smooth operation at all times.
- Cost optimisation: Cost is an important aspect for any business. Minimising the cost of using these resources is a part of the management services provided. These models generally offer a pay-as-you-go structure, which makes it extremely cost-effective, especially for small and medium businesses that do not have extensive resources. If these resources are not managed properly the business may find themselves paying far more than they initially anticipated.

Cloud infrastructure management can be performed by the cloud service provider or by the customer, depending on the specific cloud services being used. Effective and efficient management of your cloud infrastructure is critical for ensuring the reliability, security, and performance of cloud environments, and for controlling costs and optimising the use of resources. Without proper management of these resources, a business may not be able to make use of the benefits offered by this model, which is why many companies tend to outsource their needs to third-party providers. Outsourcing such services will help businesses to focus on more important aspects of their operations, rather than spending time and resources on complex tasks.
