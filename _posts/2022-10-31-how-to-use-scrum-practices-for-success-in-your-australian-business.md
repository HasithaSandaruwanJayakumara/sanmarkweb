In today’s world, Scrum methodologies are well known for delivering software development products on schedule and within budget. However, this is changing. Many Australian businesses are now streamlining a wide range of business processes using the specific rules of Scrum. Each of them makes it simpler, more effective and more efficient.

## What is Scrum Methodology?

Before we get into how the business world can use Scrum methodologies, let’s define Scrum.

The Scrum methodology is a project management system based on incremental development. Each iteration comprises two to four-week sprints to complete the essential features and produce a potentially deliverable product. Subsequent sprints add more features to the product, and they are adjusted based on stakeholder and customer feedback between sprints.

Consider a company that needs to create a new product for its customers. Traditionally, the company might create the product using a “conveyor belt” methodology: the development begins in one department, is passed to another, where they work on their piece, and then passed on again until it reaches its final delivery point.

**On the other hand, a Scrum team divides the new product into small batches of functionality that they can finish quickly. This cycle repeats until the entire product is delivered — a product that meets the customer’s needs because the company was able to adjust the fit at the end of each time frame.**

## In Which Situations Can We Implement the Scrum Methodology?

Scrum applies to almost all project kinds, including software development, sales, marketing for introducing a new product, and event planning, among many other activities. It allows for great collaboration among team members, which implies that teams with diverse skill sets can readily collaborate positively. Scrum may be the project management strategy to choose if you want an organised and flexible management structure. That is why you should apply the Scrum technique in your company.

There are no particular requirements or prerequisites for adopting Scrum; anyone can begin using it immediately. All you need is a group of people willing to collaborate toward a common objective and welcome flexibility as part of the business process.

Scrum is employed by many enterprises, from start-ups to multi-million dollar corporations in Australia. It’s popular because it’s versatile and adaptable to a wide range of applications, large and small.

Suppose you constantly have problems with time management, employee management, and quality control. In that case, you should move to Scrum as soon as possible.

## How We Do Scrum Methodology in Sanmark?

There are mainly 5 phases in the Scrum methodology that we implement.

- **Client Approach**

This stage entails communicating with you to get your ideas. This step shapes the final product.

- **Requirement Analysis**

    This phase aims to convert the needs and high-level requirements into precise (measurable and testable), traceable, complete, consistent, and stakeholder-approved requirements. Business Analysts do this.

- **Solution Architecting**

    System Architects use what the Business Analysts found in the Requirement Analysis to propose the architecture for the system to be built.

    Solution Development

    The work begins once a team has determined the requirements. UX designers and developers start working on the project’s initial iteration to have a viable product to launch by the conclusion of the sprint. Additional sprints can and will be held by the team to improve the overall outcome.

    Separated steps conduct this phase. As follows:

  - Solution Backlog
  - Sprint Backlog
  - Planning
  - Implementing
  - Review
  - Retrospective
  - Completed Task

- **Solution Finalisation**

    It is the final step, in which we deliver final deliverables to stakeholders, such as putting a product to market or offering created technology to a client.

- **Future Requirements**

    Once the initially agreed-upon solution is developed and launched, the client can present their ideas for improving the software system. Sanmark can restart the larger workflow again, starting with the Requirement Analysis.

There are several advantages to using the Scrum methodology. First, it encourages faster product development because teams must complete each set of goals within the time frame of each sprint. It also necessitates frequent planning and goal setting, which assists the Scrum team in focusing on the sprint’s objectives and increasing productivity.

Scrum has enabled us to produce high-quality work more efficiently. It fosters collaboration among departments and allows us to identify issues that may harm operations. It promotes the advancement of quality.

Scrum focuses on quality improvement because its primary goal is to increase productivity. However, team leaders must allot time to the staff to discuss how they should do the job. It will make their commitments more attainable by allowing them to learn from their successes and failures.

The Scrum approach takes time to integrate; the process will take some time as employees transition from a project-based to a team-centred framework. However, the initiative is rewarding, and you will have happier teams and a more prosperous and productive organisation.
