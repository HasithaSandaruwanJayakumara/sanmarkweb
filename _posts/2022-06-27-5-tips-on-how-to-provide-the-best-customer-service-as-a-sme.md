Did you know that 90% of startups and small businesses screw up? According to studies, 21.5% of startups fail in their first year, 30% in their second year, and 50% in their fifth year.

Excellent customer service develops lifelong customers who are willing to recommend your company to their friends, family, and coworkers. Providing exceptional customer service begins with a genuine desire to please your consumers, but you must also consider factors other than selling your products or services. You should think about your consumers’ overall experience when they visit your store, access your website, or open your app; what they think and feel; and what you can do to improve it.

## What is Good Customer Service?

Good customer service entails supporting consumers in real-time and meeting their particular requirements and expectations. That’s not all, though; client service qualities such as empathy, patience, a positive attitude, problem-solving, active listening, and others are essential.

In the present era, excellent customer service entails enabling clients through self-service and reducing the need for agent intervention.

Let’s see what you can adapt for your business.

### 1. Knowledge About Your Service or Product

To provide the best customer service, you must know what you’re offering inside and out, to deliver excellent customer service. Make sure you and your front-line employees understand how your products or services work. Be aware of the most often asked queries by consumers, and know how to respond in a way that will satisfy them.

### 2. Be Distinct and Unforgettable

Social media is among the most effective platforms for doing so. Spotify, for example, has a dedicated customer service Twitter feed called ‘SpotifyCares.’ The company also informs customers about product improvements, such as unavailability and new additions. Their support team responds to clients with funny comments and includes their product in every Tweet. It’s also a good idea to look at examples of good customer service on social media.

### 3. Be Kind and Pleasant

A smile is the first step in providing excellent customer service. When your consumers ask for assistance and you are in a face-to-face setting, a friendly greeting should be the first thing they see and hear. A grin can come through in your voice even when processing customer service requests over the phone, so are prepared to be cheerful.

### 4. Gather Customer Feedback Every Time You Can

The most effective method to improve your product or service is to listen to what your consumers have to say about it. However, finding the correct tools to collect this input is the real issue for small businesses. Here are some methods for gathering their interesting thoughts:

- #### Customer Polls

    This is one of the most cost-effective and efficient ways for customers to express themselves. Make a list of simple questions that may be offered as open text feedback, such as, “What can our staff do better in terms of providing support?” “How happy are you with our customer service on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 – unsatisfied to 10 – very satisfied?)” or “How satisfied are you with our customer support on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 – unsatisfied to 10 – very satisfied?”)”

- #### Requests for New Features

    You can set up a platform for customers to submit requests for new features. Customers will be able to vote for the features they want in feature requests. This straightforward yet useful help center solution allows decision-makers in your small business to track and prioritize clients’ requirements.

- #### Use of Social Media

    There are millions of individuals using different social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.) around the world, so it’s only natural that you’ll discover your current – and future – consumers there as well. It’s not simply for publishing flashy promotional campaigns on social media. Many firms, large and small, have formed social media customer service to assist users and collect both positive and negative feedback.

### 5. Train Your Staff

It’s critical that all your staff, not just customer care reps, know how they should communicate with, engage with, and generally assist consumers. Provide training that equips your employees with the skills they need to provide excellent service throughout the client experience.
