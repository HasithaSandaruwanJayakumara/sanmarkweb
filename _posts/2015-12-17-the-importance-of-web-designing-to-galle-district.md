With approximately 1600 km of of palm fringed Coastline baked to perfection surrounding the country Sri Lanka is known as the ideal destination for beach bums worldwide. May it be windsurfing, kayaking, yachting, water skiing, scuba diving or jut lazing around for the perfect tan, Sri Lanka offers all of it.

If concern specially about Galle distric, there are plenty of famous tourists destinations in this beautiful district. Unawatuna beach, Hikkaduwa beach, Ambalangoda beach and Kosgoda beach are known as the famous sea beaches in Galle district where you can find glowing coral reefs and chic boutique hotels.

If concern about Ambalangoda town in Galle, it is known as a very famous place for traditional low country dancing events including mask meusems. A lots of tourists are gathering here to discover our cultural heritage.

Every tourist who visits Sri Lanka will never leave this beautiful Island without paying a visit to turtles in Kosgoda which is also situated in Galle district. The turtles are known as a rare species in the world. Since female turtles are coming to Kosgoda beach to lay, this place is also a famous tourist destination in Sri Lanka. There are a few centers where turtles are being looked after in Kosgoda area.

As you can understand, there are plenty of sources in Galle district which directly or indirectly contribute to improve the economy of Sri Lanka. But there is one problem. Without having a proper media, we canâ€™t spread the word about these sources to the outside world. That is why you must have a proper website to spread the word about you if you are running a business like the above mentioned sources. For an example if you are running a boutique hotel, you must include your details in a directory such as booking.com so that others can reach you. You may be wondering why you should include your details if you have a website for your hotel. When it comes to search engine optimization, your website may not be appeared on the first page of search result but if you include your details in such a directory, your guests can reach you more efficiently since those booking directories are optimized for search engines.
