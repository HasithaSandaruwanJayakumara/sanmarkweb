Many small businesses, especially new ones, have tight budgets. They focus on necessities and urgent matters. They only invest money when they need to. So, it’s easy to see why for some business owners a website is luxy they can’t afford right now.

They may even think that a Facebook profile is sufficient for an online presence, that an ad with their phone number will generate calls, or that traditional email advertising will help them sell products. However, the truth is that a big part of the way to start promoting a business is to build a professional website.

An effective website is the backbone of your business: it houses important information and customers expect you to have one.

A website functions as a portal for customers to learn more about your company, as well as research product information and determine if they want to do business with you. If you are a small business owner, you should know that a website is not a lavish expense or a frivolous endeavour, but an affordable and essential tool that every small business needs.

## You Need a Website to Power Up Your Marketing

Before you print a business card or invest in advertising, you need to start marketing by building a website.

A website will function as the backbone for all your advertising efforts. All company details, product information and promotion should live on your website first. Then, you can create internet marketing campaigns that are aligned with your domain name. This will attract customers to your website for more information.

## 1. It Will Allows You to Sell Your Products and Services Online

A website acts as a digital brochure in which you share up-to-date information about your offerings. A benefit of publishing on a website is that you can change the information in real-time, without having to wait or pay for new printed materials.

Think of your website as around-the-clock staff. It provides answers to frequently asked questions and can even process sales. Websites with e-commerce and shopping options allow users to make direct purchases online. Thus, you simplify sales to staff and customers.

## 2. Customers Will Find Out About You More Easier

Even if you already have an established customer base, a website is a sure way to connect with new customers who may not know about your business.

Often, people turn to the internet when they have a problem. Searching for solutions is easy. However, is your business a potential problem solver? With a professional website, you position your company as a solution to customers’ needs. In addition, you can optimize your site with search terms related to your industry. This will expose your company to new customers.

## 3. Local Businesses Have a Lot of Advantages

One misconception about websites is that they are only for national businesses or global corporations with customers around the world. In reality, websites are just as beneficial, if not more so, for small businesses. In fact, it’s a great way to connect with local customers.

Also, search engines often present results according to location. In other words, if you’re searching for “shoe stores near me,” Google won’t show you a result for New York (unless you live in New York.).

It’s very clear, an online presence has great benefits even for small local businesses. No matter where you are located, you can start with an efficient website that attracts customers.

## 4. Your Business Will Look More Professional

Nothing is more important than the ability to be found. If you don’t have an established online identity, then customers can’t find you. Not appearing in search results (or on the internet) is one of the fastest ways to lose credibility as a business. It makes your company look outdated and untrustworthy.

Even if you’re fantastic at word-of-mouth marketing, you may be losing a lot of referrals. Happy customers are quick to share what they think about your business, but what about their friends who haven’t experienced your services? They will turn to the internet and when they leave empty-handed, you will have lost your chance to get new customers.

## 5. You Set the Story of Your Business Through Your Website

If you think that having a Facebook page or being listed in an online directory (such as Yellow Pages) is enough to promote your business, you are wrong.

When you publish or rely on a third-party platform, you are at their mercy. If the platform decides to close your account, change its policies or revise its programming, you may lose the ability to connect with your customers. However, when you run your own website, you are in control of the content you produce and the platform you maintain.

## 6. It is not that Complicated to Create a Website.

Many business owners use a third-party platform and avoid creating their own website because they think it’s complicated or expensive.

However, building and maintaining a website is easier and cheaper than ever before. Even if you are not tech-savvy or creative, you can now use simple web publishing tools to build a website in a couple of hours. The prices to host a website are very cheap. You can also get professionals to get you a really neat site, that will make your company stand out from the rest.

Take our advice, small business owners. There are no more excuses to put off building your website. If you’re hurting your business, it’s time to get started!
