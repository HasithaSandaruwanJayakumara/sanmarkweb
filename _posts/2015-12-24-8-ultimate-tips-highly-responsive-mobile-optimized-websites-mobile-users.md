## Tips for mobile-friendly websites

Before we dive into tips for mobile-friendly websites, it’s vital to note that the user we’re developing a website for is “mobile.” These are users that expect an entirely different web experience from your website as opposed to standard desktop sites.

For instance, some may just want to get directions to office location, others may want your contact numbers or maps to your store locations. In a nutshell, such users are not into lengthy information such as white papers or e-books. Now, with that in mind, here are tips that you should have in mind when designing mobile-friendly websites:

### \#1: Always simplify your content

You’ve already identified who your buyer personas are—by conducting marketing research—and understanding what content you’d like to share with them. It’s time you go a step further by simplifying this content in a manner that your mobile user will understand. You should explain your content using measures that are as simple as possible.

### \#2: Optimize your page titles and Meta descriptions

If you’re working with a less screen size for mobile devices, you should optimize your web page title and Meta definitions to fit that size. This will help your mobile users when they’re searching for your content using their mobile devices. To achieve this, you’ve to be as concise as possible—without sacrificing the quality of your content—when creating your page titles, URLs, and Meta definitions.

### \#3: Ensure your site’s responsive configurations are mobile-optimized

The most vital decision that you’ll make when setting up your mobile website will be ensuring that it is responsive. While you’ll also have to figure out whether your website is dynamic or a separate site with its configuration—it’s important to improve its responsiveness if you want your mobile users to access it without many hassles.

You can use CSS3 to help you define media queries so that you serve the same content to your mobile and desktop users—using the same fluid grid and flexible designs that automatically adapts to the size of your mobile users’ smartphone or tablets’ screen.

### \#4: Avoid using pop-up windows

The process of navigating between several tabs in mobile browser’s window can be quite challenging and cause slow load times for your website. To steer around this problem, you can block pop-up windows in your mobile website—by alerting your mobile users on how they can navigate back to original pages.

### \#5: Reduce unnecessary amount of text is entered from keypads

Here’s a fact—majority of mobile users find it extremely difficult to use their keyboards—some mobile devices have very tiny keypads. For you to assist such users, you’ve to design your website in a manner that doesn’t require too much text to be entered from their keypads.

How can you reduce unnecessary entry of text through keypads? Well, you can design your website with drop-down menus, checklists, and other pre-populated fields to help your users with data entry. By developing your website with these tools, you’ll be allowing mobile users who have tiny keypads to access your content.

### \#6: Avoid using Flash

Some mobile devices may be lacking the plugins to access flash applications. Therefore, if you create your website with flash, you’ll be preventing users who don’t have flash plugins on their mobile devices to access your content. You can use HTML5 instead of flash to create the same special effects that you’d achieve with flash.

### \#7: Plan your content around readability

The content that you’d like to share with your customers has to be decipherable for it to make an impact concerning digital marketing. In this regard, you’ve to ensure that your content is readable by ensuring that it’s:

- Large enough—with easy-to-read text.
- Has large and clear images that can be understood.
- Simple regarding layouts.
