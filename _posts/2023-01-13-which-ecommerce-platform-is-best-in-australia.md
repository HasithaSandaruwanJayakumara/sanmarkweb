These days everyone is online, whether it is for entertainment purposes, socialising or carrying out their day-to-day activities like shopping, making appointments etc. With smartphones and other smart devices becoming an essential part of everyday life for people, this new trend is sure to improve over the months and years to come, which is why for a business that is selling products and services, an ecommerce website is of vital importance. These types of websites can be quite complex, and the reason why you will need the help of a company with immense experience in ecommerce web development for Melbourne and Sydney businesses, if you are also thinking of taking your brick-and-mortar store to the online arena.

## Why is ecommerce so important for business?

With the shift in consumer behaviour from physical shopping to online shopping, businesses have found the need to create a presence for themselves online if they want to keep up with their competition. This trend took a sharp upward turn during the global Covid-19 pandemic when many countries were under lockdown, and the only way that businesses could manage to stay afloat was if they sold online. People too began to see the convenience and ease offered by these online stores, and have continued with the trend, post pandemic as well.

According to experienced companies who carry out web design and development for Melbourne and Sydney based businesses, there are many benefits that a business can enjoy by having an online store. These include:

● **Broaden your horizons:** While a traditional brick and mortar store limits a business’s operations into one specific geo location, with an ecommerce store there is no restriction on whom you can reach. Businesses can even reach global customers with an online store, increasing their potential to earn higher revenue and profits.

● **Accessible to customers at any time:** An online store is always open, and customers can buy goods and services at any time convenient to them. This allows for more opportunities in terms of sales, as there is no closing time, like in a physical store.

● **Highly scalable:** When looking to scale your physical store, you will need to consider the costs and time and so many other factors as well. However, with an online store, scaling your business with an enhanced product range is simple and easy, and costs just a fraction of what you would spend growing a retail store.

● **Better marketing opportunities:** An ecommerce website will open up more marketing opportunities for a business at just a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing techniques.

## How to get an ecommerce website developed?

There are millions of ecommerce websites around the world, and one of the most important factors when getting one developed is that it offers a great user experience that will keep your customers coming back to it over and over again. This is why you need to hire a company that has a lot of experience in web design and development.

A good web development company will understand your business goals, your industry, your products or services and will create an ecommerce website that suits your specific requirements. They will also give you a choice of how you want to get it done; whether you want it built from scratch or customise an existing website design according to your business specifics. In addition, they will also discuss with you and make recommendations for the most suitable ecommerce platform available for your website.

## What are the different ecommerce platforms available in Australia?

![Different ecommerce platforms available in Australia.]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/Which-eCommerce-Platform-is-Best-in-Australia-Middle.jpg){:width="800" height="400" .img-fluid .w-100}

There are many different ecommerce platforms that are being used in Australia by companies that provide web development services. However, not all of these are the same, and what is ideal for one business may not be good for another.

According to Kosala Indrasiri, the Founder and CEO of Sanmark Solutions, **“*At Sanmark Solutions, we have helped many Australian businesses succeed online by building custom ecommerce solutions. While there are many great ecommerce platforms available, we believe it’s important for business owners to carefully consider their options and choose a platform that offers the features and support they need to achieve their goals. Whether you’re just starting out or looking to upgrade your existing ecommerce platform, we can help you find the solution that works best for your business.*”**

So, what are some of the more commonly used ecommerce platforms in Australia? According to articles published by Ecommerce Platforms (**[Best Ecommerce Platform Australia (Jan 2023): Top Picks – Ecommerce Platforms](https://ecommerce-platforms.com/articles/best-ecommerce-platform-australia)**) and Mobile Transaction (**[6 Best Ecommerce Platforms in Australia](https://www.mobiletransaction.org/au/best-ecommerce-platform-australia/)**) the following are some of the best ecommerce platforms used for Australian businesses. Let’s have a look at each of them!

### 1. Shopify

Similar to Shopify, this too is a subscription-based platform, but rates tend to be a little higher than the former.

Users can enjoy many features offered by BigCommerce, irrespective of which subscription plan they choose, which is why many businesses are favouring this platform.
