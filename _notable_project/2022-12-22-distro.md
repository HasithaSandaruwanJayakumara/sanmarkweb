Distro# is a software provided by Sanmark as a service. It is designed to support you with every aspect of managing your product distribution agency. Distro# will assist you from buying goods from vendors, and storing them in your stocks, to selling the goods to your customers.

You can keep track of flow of your money as well. Distro# presents you with built-in support for managing financial accounts. Each vendor and customer has their own financial account, but you get to create as many financial accounts for your business. Every transaction is done between your accounts and their accounts, and all finance transactions can be separately tracked.

Distro# comes with a powerful user permission system. You can have as many users as you need and assign various permissions to them. Their permissions will decide which parts of the system they will have access to.
