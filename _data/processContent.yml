                  magic begins. You take the first step by deciding to give us a call, send us
                  an email, or drop us a message through one of the contact forms on our
                  website. Once we receive your message, our team will get right back to you
                  for more information and to answer any questions you may have regarding your
                  custom software development solution."

  image: "/assets/img/process/process_2.webp"
  content: "<span class='bullet_ltr'>This starts with 2
            Hours of free of charge consultation with no commitments from you, so there
            is no need to hesitate. After the initial communication, one or more of our
            Business Analysts will meet with you online to gather your requirements for
            your exciting new project. Whether or not we would charge you for this
            detailed analysis will depend on the scope and the scale of the project. It
            can involve a couple of meetings to fine-tune your needs. Our Business
            Analysts will produce the “Software Requirements Specification” (SRS)
            document at this stage. At the end of this step, we will give you a
            preliminary estimate of the cost and time for the project. If you agree with
            it, we can proceed to the next stage, or we can make the necessary changes
            until it matches your budget.</span>"

            Architects will jump on the project at this point. They will study the
            “Software Requirements Specification” (SRS) document the Business Analysts
            prepared and envision the best solution for your requirements. As a
            responsible and transparent custom software development company, we will
            keep you fully informed and work with you to ensure our architecture aligns
            with what you have in mind. At the end of this stage, we will give you a
            “Software Solution Specification” (SSS) for your approval."

  image: "/assets/img/process/process_4.webp"
  content: "<span class='bullet_ltr'>This is the exciting
            part where everything will come to life! We follow the “Scrum Practises”
            that are known to produce timely results to manage the development portion
            of the project. You will be able to get directly involved in the development
            process by reviewing results at the end of each “Sprint”. A “Sprint” is
            usually 2 weeks. Thanks to this approach, you will have something tangible
            to check and review from the beginning of the project. You don’t have to
            wait till the end of the project to get your hands on your custom software
            development solution as some other companies may have you do.</span>"

  content: "Parallel to the
            development, our Quality Assurance Engineers, ensure that the software being
            developed matches all the quality specifications of the project. We will
            also ensure the best security standards are implemented in your software
            system. Performance of the software is also a key factor we consider when
            testing our products. Our Quality Assurance Engineers use proven
            technologies, tools, and methodologies to ensure that the final product is
            top-notch."

  content: "<span class='bullet_ltr'>Once the development
            team is done going through all the sprints, and we have software built
            following the “Software Requirements Specification” (SRS) and “Software
            Solution Specification” (SSS) document we produced earlier, we can declare
            the product as completed. At this stage, we can deploy the software to an
            online server, or devices of your choice, as per the nature of the project.
            You can also send us your finalising comments and reviews on the product.</span>"

  content: "As an experienced
            custom software development company, we know that software and requirements
            are not static; they are constantly changing. You will get more ideas on
            improving your new software during the above stages, and you will want to
            tell us all about your new ideas for the project. Once we release the
            initial version of the product, we can begin the cycle again. We will
            analyse your fresh new requirements and kick-start work on them again. This
            is one of the reasons that we are the preferred choice when it comes to
            custom software development for Melbourne and Sydney based businesses!"
