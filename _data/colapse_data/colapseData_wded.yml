  description: "When considering ecommerce web development for Melbourne and Sydney based businesses, the time taken for the entire development cycle up to implementation can take from a few weeks to a few months, depending on the size, complexity, features and design goals of the site. A very simple site may be ready to go live in just a few weeks, however one with hundreds or thousands of products and complex features, may take several months. We at Sanmark Solutions will carry out a project analysis prior to starting work on it, so that we can properly calculate timelines and deliverables."
