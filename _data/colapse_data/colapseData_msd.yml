- title: "Does Microservice Software Development differ from traditional monolithic architecture?"
  description: "Yes, In conventional monolithic architecture, a software system's functionality is built into a single, large codebase. With Microservice Software Development, the functionality is broken down into small, modular services that can be independently developed, deployed, and scaled."

- title: "Does using Microservice Software Development increase the cost of development?"
  description: "No. While some additional costs may be associated with setting up and maintaining the infrastructure required for Microservice Software Development, the benefits of faster development, easier maintenance, and greater scalability often outweigh the costs."
