  id: "list-item-1"
  description: "Software staff augmentation helps you to expand and strengthen your development team for more efficient delivery of projects, but without the hassle of recruiting full-time employees, such as advertising, paperwork and worries about turnover rates. It is much faster than recruiting new employees and reduces your costs to just a fraction of what you would spend if you hired full-time staff. If you want to replace any team members, this too can be done easily and efficiently, so as not to hinder your ongoing project work."
- title: "Do I need to train the team members I get through software staff augmentation?"
  description: "Definitely not! We offer professional team members from our own pool of talents and expertise, so they are fully conversant with their specific roles and responsibilities. In addition they are well aware of how companies operate, in terms of discipline and other internal matters. This means that they can start working as soon as they join your team, and there is no need for any time spent on training them."
