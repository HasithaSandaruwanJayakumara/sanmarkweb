We are happy to share with you that we have completed another project.

**Bidder.com.au** is an online real estate auction software system developed by Sanmark for an Australian client, which has all the features required for a real-time real estate auction. We spent nearly one year working on this project. And we are happy to mention that we will continue to work with the client as a long-term service provider for their future project development and maintenance.

The system has multiple complex features, and we also used many advanced technologies. The system is also well-equipped to handle many visitors at a given time.

Through this project, our team got to work with new technologies. We made use of microservice architecture heavily in this project. It was fun working in different services by making them work together at the end.
