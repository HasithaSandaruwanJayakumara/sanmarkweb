Sanmark Solutions always encourages a healthy work-life balance. As an initial step, we started a New Indoor Sports Area within our office premises to promote a fit lifestyle to perform in the best possible way. There are two separate spaces allocated for Table Tennis and Carrom. We ensure a healthy lifestyle by encouraging participation in sports activities as follows.

This new facility is in addition to the outdoor Badminton Court we have been playing in for quite a while.

- Encouraging discipline and team bonding
- Improves judgement and management skills
- Boosts employee engagement
- Achieving health and fitness goals
- Gracefully accepting failures
- It helps in de-stressing from work.
