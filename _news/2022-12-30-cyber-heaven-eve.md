Last evening on the 23rd, Sanmark Solutions pulled out all the stops to celebrate the end of another successful year at our annual year-end party.

It was held at the Cinnamon Transcript Hall in the Hikka Tranz in grand style. 

The organizing team of Sanmark beautifully organized it. An automatic welcome system welcomed all members with QR code scanning and stars shining to sit at the tables.

That wonderful evening covered many interesting events.

We appreciated every employee by presenting gifts and appreciating their hard work.

The real highlight of the evening was the special speech by the company’s CEO, who took to the stage to thank the team for their hard work and present the company’s progress over the past year.

The event featured DJ music, and the employees were treated to an international buffet dinner from Hikka Tranz at Cinnamon Hotel.

We allowed every employee to take photos, and most enjoyed it with their family and friends.

As the night drew close, employees left the party grateful and excited for what next year would bring. As one employee said, “I can’t believe how much we’ve accomplished this year. It’s been an absolute pleasure to be a part of this team, and I can’t wait to see what happens at next year’s closing party.”
