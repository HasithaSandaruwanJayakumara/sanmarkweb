Employees are the most crucial asset in an organisation. We are always trying to Create a happy working environment and build the employee bond. We started Sanmark’s annual year-end programme to achieve employee well-being. 

We successfully held our first year-end function on 17th December at Citrus Hotel in Hikkaduwa. It was an excellent opportunity for all our employees to bond and enjoy each other. We will be delighted to continue this as a company.
