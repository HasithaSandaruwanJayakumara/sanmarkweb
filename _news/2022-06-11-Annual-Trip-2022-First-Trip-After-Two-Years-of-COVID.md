**A well-deserved break to relax, rejuvenate, and recharge!**

We are happy to announce that two years after the outbreak of the covid epidemic — which kept us unable to travel anywhere — we were able to go on an amazing trip in good health. We made this an ideal opportunity to provide a perfect work-life balance even during a pandemic. As a company, we are always concerned about the well-being of our employees and during this journey we provided them with every facility free of charge from Sanmark.

We went on a three-day trip to Sinharaja Rainforest and Udawalawa. Our group had a great time. We connected with nature and had fun.

Very excited for next year; stay tuned to find out where we’re headed next!
