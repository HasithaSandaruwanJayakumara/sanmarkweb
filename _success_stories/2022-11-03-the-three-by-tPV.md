Several ecommerce website development projects were done for the company “The Three by TPV” by Sanmark. Their current main online outlet is a full-featured ecommerce website that sells fashion items. We developed this system’s features by considering the buyers’ and sellers’ convenience. With this system, the client can manage the business on his own because this has an easy-use and easy-to-understand back office. Several reports are given to the client to get an idea of the business’s status. This system has all the capabilities of a modern ecommerce platform packed in a lightweight system. 

Thomas, Patrick and Vadim are the clients of this project. We spent about nine months time period with them to complete this project.

**Used Technologies:**  Laravel, MySQL, Docker
