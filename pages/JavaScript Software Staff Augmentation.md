  paragraph_one: "In the current cut-throat corporate arena, retaining a commendable lead demands creating an impressive online profile utilising advanced methodologies when delivering novel products or services. JavaScript ranks as one of the leading coding languages utilised across borders essential for constructing advanced web or mobile applications. Integrating competent software engineers with expertise in JS into your existing squad exemplifies an improvement in corporate targets' execution rate, hastening goal achievement timelines significantly." 
  paragraph_two: "Your company stands poised to benefit from supplementing its core technology team with experienced JavaScript developers who bring niche knowledge and technical prowess onboard: enhancements that are unlikely available amongst existing employees alone. In incorporating external support you increase capacity to take on more ambitious projects without placing undue burden on in-house colleagues or risking project quality issues along the way. Staff augmentation also has positive operations overhead effects too by reducing staffing related costs for web/software lifecycle stages outsourcing this task may leave internal employees free to capitalise upon other needs demanded by peak business expectation levels needing attention.Leveraging expert talent from highly experienced external teams promotes faster product debut cycles whilst delivering improved satisfaction metrics for users highlighting your company as professional and ahead of determined competition."
