    content: "two_paragraph"
    paragraph_one: "<span class='bullet_ltr'>Serverless backend development is an ideal choice for businesses looking to maximise growth and efficiency. By using serverless, businesses can take advantage of the pay-per-use billing model, leading to significant cost savings. This can free up resources that can be re-invested into the business, which can help to drive growth.Serverless also allows for automatic scaling of your application based on demand without requiring manual intervention. This means that your application can handle sudden spikes in traffic without any additional work on your part. This can help ensure that your application is always available and responsive to your customers, which can help drive engagement and growth.</span>"
    paragraph_two: "<span class='bullet_ltr'>Another key serverless aspect that can help drive business growth is the ability to offload much of the operational work of running your application to the underlying platform. This can allow your team to focus on more critical tasks and help to drive growth by allowing you to focus on developing and improving your application rather than managing infrastructure.</span>"
